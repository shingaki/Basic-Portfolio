    <img class="wrap-text" src="./assets/images/tamami.jpeg">I am probably unique to this class because I am close to retiring. But I never let my age get in the way of what I can or cannot do or want to do.
    So far, I have found the class to be challenging. The course is organized and the instructor, John, keeps everything moving at a good pace.

    I began my career as an engineer but my role changed to managing delivery teams. I've managed engineering teams that built and maintained systems.
    This includes corporate systems sucha as: Salesforce, PeopleSoft, and Adobe CRM.
    I have also built and maintained in-house systems. During the last 3 months, my team and I have been working on a system that will be implemented in AWS.
</p><p>
    I've spent many years managing development and QA teams, but in the last 3-4 years, I've reimmersed myself in coding.
    My goal is to continue to have a more hands-on role with my team.

    I am the only child of a Japanese mother and African-American father. I was born years ago in Okinawa, Japan.
    I spent my younger years traveling with my parents.</p>
